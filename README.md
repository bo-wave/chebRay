These are the files required to run the algorithm and examples presented in the article "Simplifying numerical ray-tracing for characterisation of optical systems". 

This code directly runs on any Matlab session that includes the chebfun toolbox. Download these files and run [main.m](https://github.com/yakir12/chebRay/blob/master/main.m) or [scallop.m](https://github.com/yakir12/chebRay/blob/master/scallop.m) to see the *Simple case study* or the *Adding complexity* sections respectively.
